                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>white-tailed deer, (Odocoileus virginianus), are a common American deer of the family Cervida that covers a huge range from the Arctic Circle in western Canada to 18 degrees
                        south of the Equator in Peru and Bolivia. The white-tailed deer get its name from the long white hair on the underside of the tail and rump. During flight the hair is flared,
                        and the tail is held aloft like a signaling flag. It belongs to the subfamily of New World deer. Although the white-tailed deer of North and South America are currently
                        recognized as one species, genetically these deer are further apart than are white-tailed and black-tailed deer in North America.</p>
                    <p>While this deer varies greatly in size, it changes little in its external appearance over its huge range. Its body and antlers are largest in cold temperate climates and on
                        productive agricultural soils but are small in the tropics, in deserts, and on small islands. Large males can stand as high as 106 cm (42 inches) at the shoulder and can weigh
                        up to 180 kg (400 pounds). The smallest variety, the Key deer of Florida, stands 76 cm (30 inches) at the shoulder and weighs 23 kg (50 pounds). The adult white-tailed deer
                        has a bright reddish summer coat and a duller grayish brown winter coat; the underparts are white. The male has forward curved antlers that bear a number of unbranched tines.</p>

                    <h2>Ecology</h2>
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>White-tailed deer thrive in forested areas, including deciduous and mixed woodlands, but they are also commonly found in grasslands, shrublands, and agricultural fields.
                        These deer prefer environments that provide ample food sources, such as acorns, fruits, and herbaceous plants, as well as cover for shelter and safety from predators.
                        They are often seen near water sources like streams, rivers, and ponds. In suburban and urban areas, white-tailed deer have adapted well, foraging in gardens and parks,
                        which has led to increased interactions with humans. Overall, their versatility in habitat selection allows them to thrive in both rural and developed landscapes.</p>
                    <h3>Environmental Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overpopulation: In some areas, particularly where hunting is restricted, deer populations can exceed the carrying capacity of their habitats, leading to habitat degradation
                            and increased vehicle collisions.</li>
                        <li>Habitat Loss: Urban development and agricultural expansion reduce their natural habitats, forcing deer into fragmented areas that limit food availability and increase
                            human-wildlife conflicts.</li>
                        <li>Disease: High population densities can lead to the spread of diseases, such as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), which threatens both deer populations and ecosystems.</li>
