            <p>
                <span class="fancy">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language 
                used to create and design the structure of web pages. 
                It allows developers to organize content using various elements, such as headings, 
                paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. 
                HTML uses a system of tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, 
                to define the roles and display characteristics of different parts of a webpage. 
                Although HTML focuses on the structure and content of a page, 
                it can also be enhanced by <span class="fancy emphasized">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) 
                for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
                Understanding HTML is fundamental to web development, 
                as it serves as the backbone of any website on the internet.

            <p>
              An HTML tag is a fundamental element in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) 
              that defines the structure and content of a webpage.
              Tags are enclosed within angle brackets—for example, 
              <span class="emphasized tag">&lt;tagname&gt;</span>—and usually come in pairs consisting of an opening tag 
              and a closing tag (e.g., <span class="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span> and <span class="tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> for a paragraph). 
              The content placed between these tags is affected by their specific function, 
              instructing web browsers on how to display or interpret that content. 
              By using various tags, developers can organize text, embed images, create links, and build the overall layout of a website.
