      <h3>RUSH FOR WORKS ON ECLIPSES</h3>
      <h4>Library Unable To Supply Demand For the Past Three Days.</h4>
      <p>
        While the eclipse has possibly been uppermost in the minds of all
        Londoners for the past week or so and the word <q>eclipse</q> is a by-word in
        almost every household and business establishment, the prominence of the
        solar phenomenon has been felt the keenest at the public library.
        Librarian R. E. Crouch states that hundreds of people have invaded the
        library during the past three or four days seeking infomration on the
        eclipse and the library has been unable to supply that demand. Those who
        left their visit to the library to the last couple of days were
        disappointed because all of the books in the institution were out some
        10 days earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q
          >We have about 75 volumes pertaining to the exlipses in the library,
          and all of those were out nearly two weeks ago,</q
        >
        states Librarian Crouch.
        <q
          >We have literally been swamped with callers seeking information on
          this matter and we were not able to supply near the demand for
          literature which the phenomenon has caused.</q
