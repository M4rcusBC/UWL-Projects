                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p> The grizzly bear is a kind of brown bear. Many people in North America use the common name “grizzly bear” to refer to the smaller and lighter-colored bear that occurs
                        in interior areas and the term “brown bear” to refer to the larger and typically darker-colored bear in coastal areas. However, most of these bears are now considered
                        the same subspecies. In North America there are two subspecies of brown bear (Ursus arctos): the Kodiak bear, which occurs only on the islands of the Kodiak
                        Archipelago, and the grizzly bear, which occurs everywhere else. Brown bears also occur in Russia, Europe, Scandinavia, and Asia. </p>
                    <p> Grizzly bears are large and range in color from very light tan (almost white) to dark brown. They have a dished face, short, rounded ears, and a large shoulder hump.
                        The hump is where a mass of muscles attach to the bear's backbone and give the bear additional strength for digging. They have very long claws on their front feet that
                        also give them extra ability to dig after food and to dig their dens. Grizzly bears weigh upward of 700 pounds (315 kilograms). The males are heavier than the females
                        and can weigh 200 to 300 kilograms (about 400 to 600 pounds). A large female can weigh 110 to 160 kilograms (about 250 to 350 pounds) in the lower-48 States</p>

                    <h2>Ecology</h2>
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>In the lower 48 states, grizzly bears are most commonly found in national parks and protected areas, like Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, where they roam
                        mountainous terrains and valleys. In Alaska, they inhabit coastal regions, river valleys, and remote wilderness areas, taking advantage of the rich salmon runs
                            during spawning seasons. Overall, grizzly bears prefer areas with good cover for denning and foraging, along with access to water sources.</p>
                    <h3>Environmental Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Habitat Fragmentation: Urban development, road construction, and logging can isolate bear populations, hindering their ability to find food, mates, and migrate safely.</li>
                        <li>Climate Change: Changes in climate affect food availability, such as the timing of berry production and salmon runs, which are crucial for bear survival.</li>
                        <li>Human Encroachment: Increased human activity in bear habitats leads to more human-bear encounters, often resulting in bears being relocated or euthanized due to conflicts.</li>
                    </ul>
