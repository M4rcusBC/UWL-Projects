                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Nestled among the rolling hills and lush woodlands of the Mississippi River Valley, the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse Bowhunting Club is a passionate community of students united by their love for the outdoors and the art of archery.
                        Founded in 2010, the club offers a welcoming space for both seasoned bowhunters and newcomers eager to learn the ropes.</p>
                    <p>Members engage in a variety of activities, from organized bowhunting trips in the surrounding natural reserves to weekend archery practice sessions at the campus range. The club emphasizes safety, ethics, and conservation, ensuring that 
                        all members are equipped with the knowledge and skills to hunt responsibly.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the year, the Bowhunting Club hosts workshops on everything from equipment maintenance to tracking techniques, often inviting local experts and seasoned hunters to share their insights. Community outreach initiatives promote
                        sustainable practices and foster a connection with the local wildlife, reinforcing the club's commitment to environmental stewardship.</p>

                    <h2>Bows</h2>
                    <p>The UWL Bowhunting club uses two types of bows for club activities. Below is a picture and brief description of each.</p>
                    <img src="./images/recurve-bow.jpg" height="400" width="300" alt="Man holding a recurve bow [Stock Image]">
                    <p>Pictured above is a recurve bow. The recurve bow is characterized by its curved tips that bend away from the archer when not drawn. This design allows for greater energy storage and increased arrow speed compared to straight-limbed
                        traditional bows, which we will not discuss here. Recurve bows are typically simpler in construction, lighter, and offer a more traditional shooting experience, making them popular among archers for target shooting and traditional hunting.</p>
                    <img src="./images/compound-bow.jpg" height="400" width="300" alt="Man holding two compound bows, pictured with another man [Stock Image]">
                    <p>Pictured above is an example of a compound bow. The compound bow uses a system of pulleys and cams, which create a mechanical advantage that allows for a higher draw weight with less effort. This design enables the archer to hold the bow at
                        full draw more comfortably, improving accuracy and shot consistency. Compound bows are generally more complex and heavier due to their intricate components, making them popular for hunting and competitive shooting where precision is key.</p>

                    <h2>Animals</h2>
                    <p>The UWL Bowhunting club primarily focuses on the pursuit of larger game, such as bears and deer. Below is a brief overview of each animal. Click the name of the animal to view more information.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="bear.html">Grizzly Bear</a><br>Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) are generally larger and heavier than other bears. Adult males average 200 to 300 kilograms (kg) (400 to 600 pounds (lb)) and
                            adult females 110 to 160 kg (250 to 350 lb) in the lower-48 States. Their coloration varies from light brown to nearly black. They can be distinguished from black bears by longer, less curved front claws, humped shoulders, and a facial
                            profile that appears concace. </li>
                        <li><a href="deer.html">White-tailed Deer</a><br>Deer are a type of mammal known as an ungulate, meaning they walk on their toes, or "Hooves". One unique characteristic of the deer family is their antlers. While horns
                            remain permanently affixed to the skull, antlers are shed every year. Although deer may be active at any time of day, they are most active near dawn and dusk.</li>
