\noindent Several of the questions have comments/expecatations/hints as footnotes. Please read through these footnotes.\footnote{Here is a short footnote before question one, so you see what the footnote looks like in the PDF and what it looks like in the LaTeX.}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a piecewise formula for the sequence $a_n$ whose first terms are\vskip1pt $1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,\dots$\vskip1pt  Comments/expecations/hints in footnote.\footnote{You may not have a recursive formula. Your formula must work for all positive integers $n$, not just up to $n \leq 20$. You should certainly {\bf check} that your formula works for $n=5$ and for $n=18$ and so on, but your formula should also work for $n=2876387$. Hint: create a piecewise formula with $4$ pieces, and look at the key for previous HW where there was a three-piece formula.}

\item Given the hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item H1: If Jax does not make jewlery, then Carl does not go camping.
\item H2: If Bo does not bake cakes, then Jax makes jewelry.
\item H3: If Kofi does not fly kites, then Fiona goes fishing.
\item H4: If Al does not like Archery, then Carl goes camping.
\item H5: If Bo bakes cakes, then Al does not like archery.
\item H6: If Carl goes camping, Kofi flies kites.
\item H7: If Jax makes jewelry, then Matthijs records music.
\item H8: If Kofi flies kites, then Matthijs does not record music.
\end{itemize}
Prove: If Al likes archery, then Fiona goes fishing.

\item Prove: for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $b \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $a$ divides $b$, and $b$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $c$.

\item Prove: for all $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $c$ is even and $d$ is odd, then $c-d$ is odd.\footnote{Note for this question: apply {\bf real} algebra, so note that order of operations matters. As another note apply the definition of odd that is given. Do NOT make up your own ``alternate'' definition of odd.}

Using the hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item For all $y \in Y$, if $y$ is a poet, then $y$ does not skateboard.
\item For all $s \in V$, for all $t \in W$, if $s$ gives $t$ chocolate, then $t$ tap dances.
\item Every element in the set $C$ is also in the set $V$.
\item Every element in the set $C$ is also in the set $Y$.
\item Every element in the set $A$ is also in the set $V$.
\item Every element in the set $B$ is also in the set $W$.
\item For all $h \in B$, if $h$ tap dances, then $h$ is happy.
\end{itemize}
prove: For all $a \in A$, for all $b \in B$, for all $c \in C$, if $c$ skateboards and $a$ gives $b$ chocolate, then $b$ is happy and $c$ is not a poet.\footnote{Take it one step at a time. For example, if we knew \fbox{For all $g \in U$, if $g$ works hard, then the boss gives $g$ a raise} and we knew \fbox{$k \in U$} was already established, then we'd get the implication \fbox{if $k$ works hard, then the boss gives $k$ a raise}. My expectation is that you write about this implication that is newly-obtained (newly-proved). Then, now that we know this implication is true, we'd be looking for an opportunity to {\bf use} it. That is, we could do something if we knew \fbox{$k$ works hard}, and we could also use the implication if we knew \fbox{the boss does not give $k$ a raise}. (My point is: slow down, take things one step at a time, and show your work. Using a for all ends up giving you a statement that is \emph{slightly} smaller.) Of course, the question that you have to work on doesn't talk about raises, working hard, etc. I just wanted to discuss based on an example that has different activities than the poetry, skateboard, tap dances, etc. in the problem.}

\item Optional (0pts). You walk home from a friend's house and run into another genie. ``Oh no, not you again!'' you exclaim. The genie lays out $12$ coins and a balance while saying, ``I'll give you one trillion dollars if you can identify which one of these twelve coins is fake, but you can only use the balance three times.'' You think for a minute, without even using scratch paper to say, ``Oh hey, that's \emph{easy} now! Give me that balance and I'll identify which of these coins is heaviest in no time!'' The genie grabs the balance from you and says, ``Not so fast! I didn't say whether the fake coin is lighter than the rest or heavier than the rest. Here, have some scratch paper.'' The genie gives an evil laugh, only to say, ``Oh, for the trillion dollars, you have to identify \emph{which} coin is fake, and whether the fake coin is heavier than a genuine coin or lighter than a genuine coin.'' Explain how using the balance at most three times, you can identify the fake, and whether it is heavier or lighter than the typical coin. Good luck!
