    \item Find a piecewise formula for the sequence $a_n$ whose first terms are\vskip1pt
          $1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,\dots$

          The piecewise formula for this sequence can be expressed as:
          \[
              a_n = \begin{cases}
                  \frac{n + 3}{4} \text{ if } n + 3 \text{ is a multiple of } 4; \\
                  \frac{n + 2}{4} \text{ if } n + 2 \text{ is a multiple of } 4; \\
                  \frac{n + 1}{4} \text{ if } n + 1 \text{ is a multiple of } 4; \\
                  \frac{n}{4} \text{ if } n \text{ is a multiple of } 4.

    \item Given the hypotheses:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item H1: If Jax does not make jewlery, then Carl does not go camping. \fbox{$\neg j
                            \rightarrow \neg c$}
              \item H2: If Bo does not bake cakes, then Jax makes jewelry. \fbox {$\neg b
                            \rightarrow j$}
              \item H3: If Kofi does not fly kites, then Fiona goes fishing. \fbox{$\neg k
                            \rightarrow f$}
              \item H4: If Al does not like Archery, then Carl goes camping. \fbox{$\neg a
                            \rightarrow c$}
              \item H5: If Bo bakes cakes, then Al does not like archery. \fbox{$b \rightarrow \neg
                            a$}
              \item H6: If Carl goes camping, Kofi flies kites. \fbox{$c \rightarrow k$}
              \item H7: If Jax makes jewelry, then Matthijs records music. \fbox{$j \rightarrow m$}
              \item H8: If Kofi flies kites, then Matthijs does not record music. \fbox{$k
                            \rightarrow \neg m$}
          \end{itemize}
          Prove: If Al likes archery, then Fiona goes fishing.

          \begin{proof}
              Assume Al likes Archer (``Al does not like Archery'' is false).

              Using H5, we know that if Bo bakes cakes, then Al does not like Archery. Since
              Al likes Archery, Bo must not bake cakes. Then, using H2, we know that if Bo
              does not make cakes, then Jax must make jewelry. Since Bo does not bake cakes,
              Jax must make jewelry. Since Jax makes jewelrey, we can apply H7 to conclude
              that Matthijs records music. By H8, if Kofi flies kites, it would contradict
              our previous finding that Matthijs records music. Therefore, Kofi must not be
              flying kites. Finally, using H3, we know that if Kofi does not fly kites, then
              Fiona goes fishing. Since Kofi does not fly kites, we can conclude that Fiona
              goes fishing.

          \end{proof}

          Proof with symbols:

          \begin{itemize}
              \item Let $j$ be the statement, ``Jax makes jewelrey''.
              \item Let $b$ be the statement, ``Bo bakes cakes''.
              \item Let $k$ be the statement, ``Kofi flies kites''.
              \item Let $a$ be the statement, ``Al likes Archery''.
              \item Let $c$ be the statement, ``Carl goes camping''.
              \item Let $m$ be the statement, ``Matthijs records music''.

          \end{itemize}

          \begin{proof}
              Assume $a$ is true ($\neg a$ is false).

              Using H5, we know that if $b$ is true, then $\neg a$ is true. Since $\neg a$ is
              false, $b$ must be false ($\neg b$ must be true). Then, using H2, we know that
              if $\neg b$ is true, then $j$ is true. Since $\neg b$ is true, $j$ must be
              true. Since $j$ is true, we can apply H7 to conclude that $m$ is true. By H8,
              if $k$ were true, it would contradict our previous finding that $m$ is true.
              Therefore, $k$ must be false ($\neg k$ must be true). Finally, using H3, we
              know that if $\neg k$ is true, then $f$ is true. Since $\neg k$ is true, $f$
              must be true.

          \end{proof}

    \item Prove: for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $b \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $c \in
              \mathbb{Z}$, if $a$ divides $b$, and $b$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $c$.

          Symbolic representation: $\forall a \in \Z, \forall b \in \Z, \forall c \in \Z,
              (a|b \land b|c) \rightarrow a|c$.

          \begin{proof}
              Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be integers. Assume $a$ divides $b$ and $b$ divides $c$. This means there exists integers $k$ and $m$ such that $b = ak$ and $c = bm$.
              Substituting $b = ak$ into $c = bm$, we get:
              \[
                  c = bm = (ak)m = a(km).
              \]
              We know $km$ is an integer because the set of integers is closed under
              multiplication, so we can conclude that $a$ divides $c$. Therefore, if $a$
              divides $b$ and $b$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $c$.
          \end{proof}

          \newpage

    \item Prove: for all $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $c$ is even
          and $d$ is odd, then $c-d$ is odd.
          \begin{proof}
              Let $c$ and $d$ be integers. Assume $c$ is even and $d$ is odd. This means there exists integers $k$ and $m$ such that
              \[
                  c = 2k \text{ and } d = 2m + 1.
              \]
              Substituting $c = 2k$ and $d = 2m + 1$ into $c - d$, we get:
              \[
                  c - d = 2k - (2m + 1) = 2k - 2m - 1 = 2(k - m) - 1.
              \]
              Let $w = (k - m).$ We know that $w \in \mathbb{Z}$ because $k$ and $m$ are
              integers, and the set of integers is closed under subtraction. Thus, we can
              conclude that $c - d$ is odd. Therefore, if $c$ is even and $d$ is odd, then $c
                  - d$ is odd.
          \end{proof}

          I have given each of these hypotheses a name, H1 through H7, to more clearly
          reference them in the proof and preserve conciseness.

    \item Using the hypotheses:

          \begin{itemize}
              \item For all $y \in Y$, if $y$ is a poet, then $y$ does not skateboard.
              \item For all $s \in V$, for all $t \in W$, if $s$ gives $t$ chocolate, then $t$ tap
                    dances.
              \item Every element in the set $C$ is also in the set $V$.
              \item Every element in the set $C$ is also in the set $Y$.
              \item Every element in the set $A$ is also in the set $V$.
              \item Every element in the set $B$ is also in the set $W$.
              \item For all $h \in B$, if $h$ tap dances, then $h$ is happy.
          \end{itemize}
          Prove: For all $a \in A$, for all $b \in B$, for all $c \in C$, if $c$ skateboards and $a$ gives $b$ chocolate, then $b$ is happy and $c$ is not a poet.

          \begin{proof}
              Let $a \in A$, $b \in B$, and $c \in C$. Assume $c$ skateboards and $a$ gives $b$ chocolate.
              Since every element in the set $C$ is also in the set $Y$, we conclude that $c \in y$.
              From H1, we note that if $c$ skateboards, then $c$ cannot be a poet. Thus, $c$ is not a poet.
              Since every element in the set $A$ is also in the set $V$, we have $a \in V$.
              According to H2, we know that because $a$ gives $b$ chocolate, it  follows that $b$ tap dances.
              Since every element in the set $B$ is also in the set $W$, we have $b \in W$.
              From H7, we know that since $b$ tap dances, $b$ is happy.
              Therefore, if $c$ skateboards and $a$ gives $b$ chocolate, then $b$ is happy and $c$ is not a poet.
          \end{proof}
