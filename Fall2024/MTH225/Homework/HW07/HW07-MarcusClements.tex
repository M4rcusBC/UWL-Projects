Show your steps --- step by step. Note that when you *use* a for all, the
statement you get is slightly smaller. (So, if you *use* statement of the form
for all \ldots if \ldots then \dots the new thing you get will be of the form if \ldots
then \ldots) For the 5th question, I used a LaTeX thing called text, but to do
this, I added the amsmath package at the top.
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Prove the following by contradiction: If the Minesweeper configuration is as
          given in Figure 3.2, then Cell B is safe. (Figure 3.2 is found in the handbook
          at the top of page 69. The number 69 is printed in the corner of the page,
          though it is the 79th page of the PDF file, due to table of contents, cover
          page, etc.)

    \newpage

    \item Prove the following by cases: If the Minesweeper configuration is as given in
          Figure 3.2, then Cell V is a mine. [Hint: start where Cells P, Q, and R are and
                  create three cases.]

    \newpage

    \item Prove: for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, for all $b \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $a+b$ is
          even, then $a-b$ is even.

    \newpage

    \item Prove: for all $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $c$ is even if and only if $c-1$ is
          odd.

    \newpage

    \item Use the hypotheses:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item H1: Every element of $D$ is an element of $A$.
              \item H2: For all $d \in D$, if $d$ raises tigers, then $d$ does not play soccer.
              \item H3: Every element of $B$ is an element of $D$.
              \item H4: Every element of $S$ is an element of $T$.
              \item H5: For all $b \in B$, if $b$ is a paramedic, then $b$ plays board games.
              \item H6: Every element of $U$ is an element of $D$.
              \item H7: For all $a \in A$, if $a$ does not raise tigers, then $a$ is a paramedic.
          \end{itemize}
          and the definitions of these sets
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $S = \{x \in D : x \text{ plays board games}\}$
              \item $T = \{c \in U : c \text{ is a barista}\}$
          \end{itemize}
          to prove: for all $b \in B$, if $b$ plays soccer, then $b$ is a barista.

\end{enumerate}
