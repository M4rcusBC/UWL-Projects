\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : 7 \text{ divides } a-b\}$. State five elements of $R$, with proper notation. Note, you must provide five examples of elements which, as a whole, helps someone truly see what kinds of things belong to $R$. This sounds like it's subjective, but it's not quite as subjective as it sounds. If you were only to provide $(7,7) \in R$ and $(14,14) \in R$ and such as elements of $R$, while true, you do not want your examples to mislead someone into a true understanding of the set $R$. Push the limits as much as possible. Go ahead and provide one or two tame elements of $R$, but be sure to give examples to show the actual variety of things that belong to $R$.

\item Let $R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : 7 \text{ divides } a-b\}$. Note that $R$ is a binary relation on $\mathbb{R}$. Prove $R$ is reflexive.

\item Let $R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : 7 \text{ divides } a-b\}$. Note that $R$ is a binary relation on $\mathbb{R}$. Prove $R$ is symmetric.

\item Let $R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : 7 \text{ divides } a-b\}$. Note that $R$ is a binary relation on $\mathbb{R}$. Prove $R$ is transitive.

\item Based on the following set definitions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $B = \{ j\text{'s cat} : j \in T \}$
\item $L = \{ z \in V \mid z \text{ scratches furniture} \}$
\item $S = \{ m \in T : m \text{ plays hockey} \}$
\end{itemize}
and hypotheses
\begin{itemize}
\item H1: $B \subseteq L$.
\item H2: For all $c \in T$, if $c$ is a baker and $c$'s cat scratches furniture, then $c$ wins GBBO.
\item H3: For all $a \in T$, if $a$ does not wear a helmet, then $a$ does not skateboard.
\item H4: For all $d \in J$, if $d$ scratches furniture, then $d$ does not wear a helmet.
\item H5: $J \subseteq V$.
\end{itemize}
prove: for all $x \in S$, for all $y \in T$, if $x$ is a baker and $y$ skateboards, then $x$ wins GBBO and $y$ wears a helmet.

\end{enumerate}
